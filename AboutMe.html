										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Hello! I am currently a grade 11 high school student at De La Salle College "Oaklands", in midtown Toronto. I have a firm interest in Computer Science and business-related ventures (such as the stock market). I would love to pursue a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in university in the near future, then a career in software development. </p>
									<p>At school, I am involved with a variety of extracurricular activities. For example, DECA, an international business competition that prepares entrepreneurs and leaders in different business fields, where I took a leadership position of section secretary, placed top 15 in regionals, as well as qualifying for provincials. I am also on the Debate Team, where I have been chosen to represent my school in many tournaments, including the Ontario Pro-Con Debating Forum and The Fulford League. As someone that loves sports, I tried out and was chosen to represent my school on the Junior Basketball Team and the Senior Badminton Team in both of my years at De La Salle (Grades 9 and 10). Feel free to take a look at my resume for more of my involvements!</p>
									<p>Outside of the classroom, I am also involved with some leadership and volunteering activtiies. For example, I am a Link Crew Leader, responsible for ensuring a smooth transition for new freshmen. I am also a House Leader at my school, responsible for a variety of duties such as organizing activities for students or presenting proposals for teachers.</p>
									<p>I am currently open to any employment opportunity, as I would love to gain some work experience before starting university!</p>
